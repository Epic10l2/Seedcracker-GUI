# Seedcracker-GUI
GUI to simplify inputting into my java seedcracker.

How to use:

In case you have a pllarseed, check the Pillarseed checkbox and input your pillarseed. In case you dont, dont check the pillarseed checkbox.

You can get the pillarseed using this: https://github.com/Epic10l2/Simple-Pillarcracker/releases
(Warning!: Servers may or may not have a different seed for the end)

If you have the first end gateway that generated, check the gateway checkbox and input the number of you gateway(list below), if not then leave the poor checkbox alone.

List of End Gateway coordinates and their corresponding numbers: 
(0 = x 96 z 0),   (1 = x 91 z 29),   (2 = x 77 z 56),   ( 3 = x 56 z 77),    (4 = x 29 z 91),

(5 = x -91 z -1),   (6 = x -30 z 91),   ( 7 = x -57 z 77)   ,( 8 = x -78 z 56),   (9 = x -92 z 29),

(10 = x -96 z -1),   (11 = x -92 z -30),   (12 = x -78 z -57),   (13 = x -57 z -78),   (14 = x -30 z -92),

(15 = x 0 z -96),   (16 = x 29 z -92),   (17 = x 56 z -78),   (18 = x 77 z .5)7  , (19 = x 91 z -30)

Click add structure button to add a new structure input, then chooses the type of structure and input the x and z CHUNK coordinates.

Clicking the remove structure button will remove the bottom input.

Select wether you want to crack the structureseed(if not then it will only output the lower 32 bits of the seed).

Select wether you want the structureseeds to be print to a file.

When you are done click the Generate list button.

In case your antivirus triggers on the .exe(which happens due to the entire python interpreter packed inside) you need to run the python file.

If you have any more questions feel free to dm me over discord (@epic10l2 ).
